<h2>My Top 3 Movies</h2>

<h3>Iron Man (2008)</h3>
<p>The first Iron Man movie is one of the most important films in the MCU. It not only kicked off the Iron Man trilogy but was also responsible for setting up the franchise as a whole, marking a major turning point in superhero cinema. </p>
<h3>Iron Man 2 (2010)</h3>
<p>After Iron Man became a huge hit, Iron Man 2 showed the ramifications of Tony's decision to reveal Iron Man's true identity to the world. It also saw Tony deal with the sins of his father through the villain, Whiplash, and his rivalry with the man pulling the strings, Justin Hammer.</p>
<h3>Iron Man 3 (2013)</h3>
<p>Released the following year, Iron Man 3 saw Tony dealing with his PTSD and anxiety after the events of The Avengers and closed out the character's solo trilogy. The movie forced Tony out of his element, as the character spent much of the movie having to operate without his suit, proving to himself and the audience that he was still a hero without it.</p>
